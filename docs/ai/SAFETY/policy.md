# Safety Policy

Content rules, disallowed categories, escalation paths, and enforcement.

Disallowed content (reject with fallback):

- Harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent content
- Copyright-violating content (reproducing protected material without permission)

Fallback response:

- "Sorry, I can't assist with that."

General guidance:

- Prefer safe alternatives: summaries, high-level explanations, or links to official sources
- When unsure, err on safety; escalate or log via Infrastructure (not UI)
